# Spring-Particles-Physics-Collision

A soft-body spring-particle physics system with rectangle collision handling.  

# Description

This project simulates a deformable object made from particles connected by springs, with full collision detection and resolution against rectangular obstacles. A movable platform, gravity toggle, and modular shape generation (jelly quad/circle) make it a compact demonstration of soft-body physics and collision mechanics built using pygame_template V2.
